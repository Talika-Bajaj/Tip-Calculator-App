# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app

![Design preview for the Tip calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 36th Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

I completed a Frontend Mentor challenge by building a tip calculator app. This project was an excellent exercise for mastering JavaScript fundamentals, as it involved implementing functional calculator logic. Itâ€™s an ideal task for beginners looking to test and enhance their JavaScript skills while creating a practical, user-friendly application.

**Had fun building this!** ðŸš€
